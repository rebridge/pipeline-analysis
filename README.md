# Complexity

In this workshop, you'll be implementing a simple static analysis for validating basic properties of code.

## Setup

### Before you get started

Import this as a notebook or clone this repo locally. Also, ensure you [install latest version of docable](https://github.com/ottomatica/docable-notebooks/blob/master/docs/install.md)!

```bash
docable-server import https://github.com/CSC-DevOps/Complexity
```

Install dependencies for our code.

```bash | {type: 'command', failed_when: 'exitCode!=0'}
npm install
```

## Static Analysis Concepts

### Why regex isn't enough?

For the same reason [why parsing html with regex is problematic](https://stackoverflow.com/a/1732454/547112).

For example, what if we just simply used a regex to detect [message chains](https://relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-mocks/docs/working-with-legacy-code/message-chains) in code? Here is a simple example that illustrates where things could go wrong.

```js | {type: 'script'}
let file = `
a.fairly.long.message.chains.with.lots.of.data.accessors;

message.
    b.
    c.
    d.
    z.
    t.
    chains();

console.log("Waiting.................");
`;

for( var line of file.split(/\n/g) )
{
    if( line.includes('.') ) {
        let mc = line.split(/[.]/g);
        if( mc.length > 4 ) {
            console.log(`[BUILD FAILED] Message chain detected with length ${mc.length}: ${line}` );
        }
    }
}
```

While we can detect one message chain, we miss one, and falsely detect another.

The short answer is that any implementation of a static analysis that results in *both* high false positives and high false negatives is going to incite an angry mob of programmers, who will insist the tool be removed from the CI pipeline.

We need a technique that is more sound, more precise, and frankly often easier to implement than a basket of regex. See [A Few Billion Lines of Code Later: Using Static Analysis to Find Bugs in the Real World](https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2010/2/69354-a-few-billion-lines-of-code-later/fulltext)

### Parsing

```js | {type: 'script'}
const esprima = require('esprima');
let ast = esprima.parse('var a = 6 * 7;');
console.log( ast );
```

Instead of treating code as a string of characters, by using a lexer and parser, we will turn those characters into tokens, and organize those tokens into a representation called an abstract syntax tree.

While is possible to [write a lexer and parser by-hand](https://github.com/CSC-DevOps/Parsing/blob/master/main.js), we can take advantage of a well-built parser for javascript, called [esprima](https://esprima.org/).

If you have not already watched this video, you can get more background about Esprima here:

### Interactive AST

We will be inspecting some simple code, and understanding its corresponding AST.

## Code Walkthrough

We will explore the template code used for performing our static analysis.

### Design Patterns 

While ASTs are powerful representations, without any tools, reasoning over ASTs can be unwieldly. Two design patterns are of importance here:

* A [Visitor pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern), which is used to abstract the process of visiting a data structure such as our abstract syntax tree (AST).

* A [Builder pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern), which is used to build up state and then finally emit. Meaning, we can incrementally calculate results as with process the AST.


### AST Visitor

```js
function printFunctionNames() {
	traverseWithParents(ast, function (node) 
	{
		if (node.type === 'FunctionDeclaration') 
		{
			console.log( `Function: ${functionName(node)} at line ${node.loc.start.line}` );
		}
	});
}
```

## Workshop

The repository contains a stub that parses a javascript file and visits each function. 

1. Run the program and print all the tokens in an ast.
   ```
      npm install
      node analysis.js
   ```

2. Do a simple calculation

   * **PackageComplexity**: The number of imports used in the file.
   * **StringCount**: The number of strings used in the file.
   * **ParameterCount**: The number of parameters for functions


3. Using multiple visitors.

   * **SimpleCyclomaticComplexity**: The number of if statements/loops + 1. For live example of a code complexity calculator, see [jscomplexity](http://jscomplexity.org/).

4. Advanced.

   * **MaxConditions**: The max number of conditions (boolean predicates inside decision node) in one if statement.
   * **MaxNestingDepth**: The max depth of scopes (nested ifs, loops, etc) -- this one is hard, only expect a few to get to do finish this one.
